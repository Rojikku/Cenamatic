#To Do
1. Maybe make it so you can bind it to a hotkey instead of every click, or something like that.
2. Actually load it from the local file that wouldn't work for some reason.
3. Get it to work on youtube and anywhere else it's broken.

Feel free to fork and contribute. I'll accept pushes as long as they work, and publish them to the chrome store. I just had the original idea, go wild with the rest.
